# To-do list app in React

This project is a to-do list app built with React, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## Accessing the app

1. Clone repo onto your computer and navigate to the directory.
2. Execute command `npm start`. This will launch and run the app in development mode.
   - (If `npm start` does not work, ensure you have React installed on your computer.)
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your chosen browser to display the app.

## Using the app

- Type in a task into the text box. You can create the task by clicking on the <b>Add task</b> button, or by pressing `enter` on your keyboard.
- To mark a task as done, click on the task text/content. It will cross out the text, indicating task completion.
  - To set the task back as "in progress", click on the task text once more.
- To modify a task, click on the <b>Edit</b> (pen & paper) icon and then on the <b>Update</b> button.
- To delete a task, click on the <b>Delete</b> (trashcan) icon.

## Upcoming improvements (as of June 2nd, 2024)

- Dark/light mode toggle
- Clearer hierarchy with complete vs. incomplete tasks
- Simple animation with e.g. task deletion
- Multi language support
- App deployment on website instead of localhost
